NOTES ON SETTING UP AN API PROJECT WITH typescript

Stage 1: Install & configure base packages
1. The first step is to init the project with npm init --yes
- this will initialize the project with all the default values.
2. Install the following devDependencies:
npm i --save-dev typescript >> The main type script typescript language

npm i --save-dev typescript ts-node @types/node >> these are the defintions for ts-node - that's so can see the node type definitions
npm i --save-dev ts-node  >> This is so we can run node projects with typescript
npm i --save-dev @types/node >> definitions for node.

3. Create the tsconfig.json by running: npx tsc --init
This will create the tsconfig.json at the root of the folder.  The tsconfig holds how the typescript will be compiled and handled.

4. Open the tsconfig.json and change the following:
 "target": "es5" /* Set the JavaScript language version for emitted JavaScript and include compatible library declarations. */,
        "lib": [
            "ES6",
            "DOM"
        ]  >> This allows us to use ES6 and manipulate the DOM (DOM is not needed for api project but required for UI development)
"module": "commonjs" /* Specify what module code is generated. */,>> This tells what type of module system require vs. import (ES6)
"rootDir": "./src" /* Specify the root folder within your source files. */, >> The location where the source ts files are  located.
"outDir": "./dist" /* Specify an output folder for all emitted files. */, >> As we compile to js, this is the location where the output is placed.
"esModuleInterop": true /* Emit additional JavaScript to ease support for importing CommonJS modules. This enables `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` for type compatibility. */,
"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true /* Ensure that casing is correct in imports. */,

/* Type Checking */
  "strict": true /* Enable all strict type-checking options. */,
  "noImplicitAny": true /* Enable error reporting for expressions and declarations with an implied `any` type.. */,
  "skipLibCheck": true /* Skip type checking all .d.ts files. */
Then outside the last brace before the json closing brace add the following:
 },
    "exclude": ["node_modules", "./dist", "spec"] // this will exclude these directories from checking.

5. Install eslint and 
npm i eslint -D >> core eslint rules
npm i eslint-config-prettier -D >> turns off any colluding rules between ESLint and prettier

6. Run the following command: npx eslint --init >> walkthrough the steps presented, use Node, common modules, save as JSON.

7. Now open the .eslintrc file and make the following changes:
{
  "env": {
    "browser": true,
    "commonjs": true,
    "es2021": true
  },
  "extends": [
    "eslint:recommended",
    "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended",
    "prettier"
  ],
  "parser": "@typescript-eslint/parser",
  "parserOptions": {
    "ecmaVersion": "latest"
  },
  "plugins": ["@typescript-eslint"],
  "rules": {
    "@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars": "error",
    "@typescript-eslint/consistent-type-definitions": ["error", "type"]
  }
}
7. Install prettier with the following command: npm i prettier -d
8. Create a file called .prettierrc.
9. Add the following suggested options:
{
  "semi": true,
  "singleQuote": true,
  "arrowParens": "avoid",
  "printWidth": 120,
  "tabWidth": 4
}
10. Add the following scripts to the 'scripts' section in package.json:
        "lint": "eslint --ext .js,.ts .", >> lints the give extensions in the root relative to this path .
        "lint:fix": "npm run lint -- --fix",  >> fixes and issues
        "format": "prettier --ignore-path .gitignore --write \"**/*.+(js|ts)\"", >> will format using prettier

Stage 2: Create the File Structure:
1. Create a directory called src at root of main directory. >> this is where ts files live.
2. Create a single file called index.ts at the \src\index.ts
3. Create another directory called tests under src.
4. Create another directory under tests called helper.
5. At the root of the project create a directory called \dist >> this is where the compiled ts to js files will be compiled too.
The directory structure should look like this:
\project
  \dist
  \src
  index.ts
    \tests 
        \helpers

Stage 3: Npm Scripts
1. Open the package.json
2. In the "scripts" section add: "build": "npx tsc".
3. Open up the index.ts 
4. Add the following code: 
function test(){
  return 5;
}
console.log(test());
5. Save and close the file.
6. From a command line run the script using: npm run build.
7. If all goes well you will see no errors.
8. Test the compiled code to see if it runs by running: node \dist\index.js
9. If all is well you should 5 print to the console.

Stage 4: Set up Testing with Jasmine.
1. Again at the command prompt run the following npm install commands:
npm i jasmine >> The jasmine test framework
npm i jasmine-spec-reporter >> for reporting - configuration in helper file (get to that later.)
2. After complete run the following command: npx jasmine init >> this initializes jasmine
3. This will create a directory called \spec\support
4. In there there will be a json file called jasmine.json.
5. Open and add the following:
{
    "spec_dir": "dist/tests",
    "spec_files": ["**/*[sS]pec.js"],
    "helpers": ["helpers/**/*.js"],
    "stopSpecOnExpectationFailure": false,
    "random": false
}
6. Save the file.
7. Now navigsate to the \src\tests\helpers directory.
8. Create a file called reporter.ts >> this is the config for the jsamine report - this needs to be compiled from ts to js to report on the run results.
9. Add the following code (from this link: https://jasmine.github.io/setup/nodejs.html)
import { DisplayProcessor, SpecReporter, StacktraceOption } from 'jasmine-spec-reporter';
import SuiteInfo = jasmine.SuiteInfo;

class CustomProcessor extends DisplayProcessor {
    public displayJasmineStarted(info: SuiteInfo, log: string): string {
        return `TypeScript ${log}`;
    }
}

jasmine.getEnv().clearReporters();
jasmine.getEnv().addReporter(
    new SpecReporter({
        spec: {
            displayStacktrace: StacktraceOption.NONE,
        },
        customProcessors: [CustomProcessor],
    })
);
10. Now navigate to the \src\tests\ and create a file called index.spec.ts.
11. Now import the file under tests using import <file> from <location>;
or alternatively use the {func, func} to pull out the functions under test.
12. Now you can write the unit test.
13. Now run the tests by using npm run test.
14. If everything is ok, then you'll see no errors but a result in the console. 

Stage 5: Install and Configure Express
1. Run the following command line: npm i  express @types/express << These are the express and type definitions
2. Create the index.ts in the src directory.
3. Create a barebones server with the following code:
import express, {Express, Request, Response} from 'express';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
dotenv.config();

const app:Express = express();
const PORT = process.env.SERVERPORT;

app.get('/', (req:Request, res:Response)=>{
    res.send('Hi there from Server!')
})

app.listen(PORT, ()=>console.log(`⚡️[server]: Server is running at https://localhost:${PORT}` ))
4. Now install nodemon (to monitor changes): npm i nodemon
5. Add the following section to the package.json (this will configure nodemon correctly for monitoring changes):
  "nodemonConfig": {
        "ignore": [ << all things here will be ignored for changes.
            "**/*.test.ts",
            "**/*.spec.ts",
            ".git",
            "node_modules",
            ".env",
            "*.txt"
        ],
        "watch": [ << what directory to watch for changes.
            "src"
        ],
        "exec": "npm start", << when changes detected, run the npm start script
        "ext": "ts" << What file extension to watch for changes on.
    }
6. Add the following to the the npm script section in the package.json:
"start:watch": "nodemon" <- this will start nodmon in watch mode.
--> when change in ts is detected then the npm start command will run 
--> remember npm start does the following: "start": "npm run build && node dist/index.js", 
  -- it builds the project and starts the server from the dist/index.js folder. Giving the user access to the site.

Stage 6: Add package dot.env to hold local variables.
1. Run the npm i dotenv 
2. Now create a file called .env
3. Anything in this file will be used on the process.env.
4. Open .env and add a string in the following format:
SERVERPORT=5055
5. Save changes & close.
6. Now open the .gitignore and add the .env file.
7. Save and close
8. Open the index.ts if not already opened.
9. Add the following lines at the beginning of the file:
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
dotenv.config();
10. This will import set the SERVERPORT on the process.env at the beginning of the launch.

Now start the server with the npm run start:watch to run in watch mode.
